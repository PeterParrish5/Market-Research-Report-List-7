<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-wear Cast Iron Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>White Cast Iron</li><li>Chilled Cast Iron</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anti-wear cast iron market includes primarily two types: white cast iron and chilled cast iron. White cast iron is characterized by its hard and brittle structure, making it ideal for high-wear applications like grinding and crushing. It exhibits superior abrasion resistance but lacks ductility. Chilled cast iron, on the other hand, is produced by cooling molten iron rapidly, resulting in a hard surface with a tough core. This type enhances durability and wear resistance, making it suitable for heavy machinery and industrial applications.</p></p>
