<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Inkjet Printer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Roof Shooter Thermal Inkjet Printer</li><li>Side Shooter Thermal Inkjet Printer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The thermal inkjet printer market comprises two main types: roof shooter and side shooter thermal inkjet printers. Roof shooter printers eject ink droplets from a vertical orientation, allowing for precise placement and efficient space utilization. They are often used in high-speed applications and compact settings. In contrast, side shooter printers discharge ink from a horizontal position, which can facilitate larger printing areas and reduces the risk of ink clogging. Each type serves specific industrial and commercial needs based on design and performance requirements.</p></p>
