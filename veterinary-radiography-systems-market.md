<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Veterinary Radiography Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Computed Radiography</li><li>Digital Radiography</li><li>Film Screen Radiography</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Veterinary radiography systems encompass three primary market types: Computed Radiography (CR), Digital Radiography (DR), and Film Screen Radiography. CR utilizes computer processing to convert captured images into digital format, offering flexibility and efficient image storage. DR, on the other hand, captures images directly in digital form, providing immediate results and superior image quality with reduced exposure times. Film Screen Radiography is the traditional method where images are captured on film, offering a more tactile approach but requiring film development and more time for results. Each type serves unique needs in veterinary diagnostics.</p></p>
