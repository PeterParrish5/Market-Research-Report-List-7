<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cirrhosis Tester Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Channel</li><li>Double-Channel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Cirrhosis Tester market is segmented into Single-Channel and Double-Channel types based on functionality. Single-Channel testers analyze one sample at a time, making them simpler and more affordable but less efficient for high-volume testing. In contrast, Double-Channel testers can process two samples simultaneously, enhancing throughput and reducing overall testing time. As a result, Double-Channel devices are often preferred in clinical settings where rapid results are crucial, while Single-Channel testers find utility in smaller facilities or for personal use.</p></p>
