<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Extraoral X-Rays Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Panoramic Type</li><li>CBCT Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dental extraoral X-ray market primarily includes two types: panoramic and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Panoramic X-rays capture a single, comprehensive image of the entire mouth, including the teeth, jaws, and surrounding structures, aiding in diagnostics and treatment planning. CBCT, on the other hand, provides three-dimensional imaging, offering detailed views of bone, teeth, and soft tissues, which enhances precision for complex cases, such as implant placements and orthodontic assessments. Both technologies are essential for modern dental practices, improving patient outcomes.</p></p>
