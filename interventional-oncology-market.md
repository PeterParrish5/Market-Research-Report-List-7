<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Interventional Oncology Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radiation Therapy</li><li>Ablation</li><li>Particle Embolization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Interventional oncology encompasses various minimally invasive techniques to treat tumors. Radiation therapy utilizes targeted radiation to shrink or destroy cancer cells while sparing surrounding tissue. Ablation techniques, such as radiofrequency or microwave ablation, destroy tumors through heat or cold, effectively eliminating malignancies without major surgery. Particle embolization involves the injection of tiny particles into the blood vessels feeding a tumor, blocking blood flow and causing cell death. Together, these modalities offer effective, less invasive alternatives for cancer treatment.</p></p>
